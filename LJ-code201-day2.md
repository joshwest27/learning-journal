# Learning Journal Day 2

Today we learned about Arrays, if/else statements and whole ot of other things. We set up Github and learned how to push data into a repository. Initally I felt overwheled like instructors mentioned we would. After taking a break and refocusing, I was able to complete the tasks fairly quickly. I feel great now.
