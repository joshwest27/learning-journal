# Learning Journal Day 2

Today we learned about Arrays, if/else statements and whole ot of other things. We set up Github and learned how to push data into a repository. Initally I felt overwheled like instructors mentioned we would. After taking a break and refocusing, I was able to complete the tasks fairly quickly. I feel great now.

# Learning Journal Day 3

Day 3 was much tougher. Did ot feel confident at all. We learned about arrays and loops. I have an understanding but not able to execute this effectively. Need more practice.
