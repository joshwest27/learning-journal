# Learning Journal Day 2

Today we learned about Arrays, if/else statements and whole ot of other things. We set up Github and learned how to push data into a repository. Initally I felt overwheled like instructors mentioned we would. After taking a break and refocusing, I was able to complete the tasks fairly quickly. I feel great now.

Day 3 was much tougher. Did not feel confident at all. We learned about arrays and loops. I have an understanding but not able to execute this effectively. Need more practice.

Day 4 was much smoother. The Loops and arrays started to make more sense and I was able to clean up my code much better. We learned functions in class and after applying functions to my code in Pair Programming, they still worked as intended. Yay!

#Learning Journal Day 5

Day 5 was fairly smooth up until lab5. It was difficult to figure out how to work a couple of the problems. I ended up finishing with a fair amount of time left but not before questioning whether I belong in web development. I definitely felt the imposter syndrome the instructors mentioned in orientation. I feel really good today and after the weekend I know I will be recharged and ready for week 2. 

#Learning Journal Day 6

Day 6 was tougher. Workload is getting pretty heavy. Definitly dont want to fall behind. I finished up the js for Lab 6 and added some CSS. Need much more practice on this. Feel very lost when trying to move stuff on the page. Will continue to read up on this.
