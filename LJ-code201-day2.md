# Learning Journal Day 2

Today we learned about Arrays, if/else statements and whole ot of other things. We set up Github and learned how to push data into a repository. Initally I felt overwheled like instructors mentioned we would. After taking a break and refocusing, I was able to complete the tasks fairly quickly. I feel great now.

# Learning Journal Day 3

Day 3 was much tougher. Did not feel confident at all. We learned about arrays and loops. I have an understanding but not able to execute this effectively. Need more practice.

# Learning Journal Day 4

Day 4 was much smoother. The Loops and arrays started to make more sense and I was able to clean up my code much better. We learned functions in class and after applying functions to my code in Pair Programming, they still worked as intended. Yay!

#Learning Journal Day 5

Day 5 was fairly smooth up until lab5. It was difficult to figure out how to work a couple of the problems. I ended up finishing with a fair amount of time left but not before questioning whether I belong in web development. I definitely felt the imposter syndrome the instructors mentioned in orientation. I feel really good today and after the weekend I know I will be recharged and ready for week 2. 

#Learning Journal Day 6

Day 6 was tougher. Workload is getting pretty heavy. Definitly dont want to fall behind. I finished up the js for Lab 6 and added some CSS. Need much more practice on this. Feel very lost when trying to move stuff on the page. Will continue to read up on this. 

#Learning Journal Day 7

Day 7 was a little harder because I forgot my laptop at home and had to swing by my work to pick up my work laptop. I managed to get everything in working order. The Lab was defintely tough. I couldnt really wrap my head aroung the concept of constructors. It wasnt until my bus ride home that it clicked. I worked a couple more hours at home to tidy everthing up. still a couple more tweaks on the code, but very happy with how its all working now. 

#Learning Journal Day 8

Day 8 wasnt too tough as far as new content. still having a hard time wrapping my head around table rows. My code seems to be coming together great but adding the totals to the bottom of the table is a little more difficult. Also need to continue learing CSS. Practice makes perfect. 

#Learning Journal Day 9

Day 9 was alright. I cant figure out the footer so I am not going to spend any more time on it. 2 days of trying to figure it out is not a good use of time. All the other elements seem to work well. Overall its going well. 

#Learning Journal Day 10

I enjoyed lab today. we were given a printout of a website that we needed to construct in 4 hours. That was challenging but fun. It was much easier than I thought it would be. The cookie-stand is still giving me trouble. Not sure why I cannot figure out the footer.

#Learning Journal Day 11

Today was pretty straight forward as far as understanding the lab. A lot of it seemed familiar since we have covered some of it in other labs. I was able to finish most of the Lab in a timely manner. Just need to tweek some things to get all of the pieces working together. Should be complete by tomorrow. 

#Learning Journal Day 12

I enjoyed todays Lab. It had its challenging moments but I was able to complete this in a timely manner. It was a bit easier since we implemented some of the tools we used from the previous lab. Remembering all the tiny pieces seem to be the toughest part. Sometimes just the most minor detail can make your entire code seem broken. Its always refresing to figure it out and see the code run. Need more days like that.

#Learning Journal Day 13

Lab was tough today. I understood the concept but couldnt quite make it work for quite sometime. I had to get a lot of assistance today which is a bit frustrating since I couldnt figure it out on my own. Local storage seemed simple in the demo but lining everything up was much more difficult. With more practice I should have a better understanding. 

#Learning Journal Day 14

Day 14 was short for me. I had an appointment up in Marysville so I wasnt there for the lecture. I was able to watch the video recording of the lecture and I do love the animation aspect of coding. Lab was a bit tougher as my group had some merge conflicts that slowed us down quite a bit. Overall I am happy where I am at in this class and look forward to learning more. 

#Learning Journal Day 15

Day 15 was pretty low key. Had code reviews and went over whats expected in Project week. Very excited for that. Overall 201 has been great. I have learned so much in such a short time. Very excited for whats to come in 301.
